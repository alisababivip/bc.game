  <h2>Google Authenticator</h2>
  <p>
    Google Authenticator offers an additional layer of security for your
    account. It is a software token that supports a two-step verification
    process. To use Google Authenticator, a mobile phone is required as it
    functions as a mobile app. It can also be used offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google Authenticator generates one-time passwords using a time-based
    algorithm. Upon launching the app, it displays a six-digit, randomly
    generated number, or one-time password. If you have enabled Two-Factor
    Authentication (2FA) for your account, you will need to enter both your
    standard password and this one-time password. 2FA enhances security by
    ensuring that your account cannot be accessed with just the username and
    password.

  <p>
    We place a high value on player security, thus strongly recommending the use
    of Google Authenticator. This minor additional step can significantly reduce
    potential stress and worry.
  </p>
  <p>
    If Google Authenticator is enabled, you will be asked to complete 2FA each
    time you log in or make a withdrawal. Additionally, it is advisable to print
    out the QR code or write down the manual code needed to recover your
    account. This is crucial in the event of mobile phone loss or damage.
