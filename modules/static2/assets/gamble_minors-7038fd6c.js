  <h2>Gamble Aware & Protecting Minors</h2>
  <p>
    Betting at an online casino is primarily for recreational purposes. However,
    a small percentage of individuals may experience a loss of control while
    gambling. It is crucial to understand that gambling should not be viewed as
    a source of income or a way to pay off debts. Monitoring the amount of time
    and money spent daily at an online casino is advisable.

    __BC_HOST__ only accepts players who are at least 18 years old and implements
    all necessary measures to prevent underage individuals from registering and
    participating in our casino activities. The casino reserves the right to
    request identification, and if a player is not of legal gambling age, they
    will be denied access to the website. However, we acknowledge that despite
    the pervasive reach of the Internet, minors under the age of 18 may still
    manage to register and gamble at online casinos. Consequently, we strongly
    urge parents to collaborate in safeguarding their children from unrestricted
    access to gambling websites. Specialized software is available to help in
    this regard. For more information, please refer to the websites listed
    below.
