    You must be at least 18 years old to register. When adding your email
    address, please ensure it is accurate as it will be needed for KYC account
    verification later.

  <p>
    You can log in at any time. For enhanced security, we recommend adding
    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Learn more about setting up Google
    Authenticator.

    Unfortunately, we are unable to update registered email addresses. If you
    need to change your username and/or registered email, we advise you to close
    your current account and create a new one.
