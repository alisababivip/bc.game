  <h2>Why is there a Withdrawal Fee?</h2>
  <p>
    When a transaction is made, it is broadcast to the network, and miners
    collate and assemble the data into production blocks. The transaction is
    only recognized after a block is produced. Miners receive a fixed monetary
    reward for mining each block, but this reward is subject to halving over
    time as per the network rules, eventually diminishing. This could lead to
    unprofitable mining operations. Thus, transaction fees are essential to keep
    miners motivated.

  <h2>The Role of the Withdrawal Fee</h2>
  <p>1. To motivate miners to continue mining.</p>
  <p>
    To prevent the network from being overwhelmed by numerous small
    transactions. The peer-to-peer (P2P) network has a limited capacity for
    processing transactions. Frequent small transactions can congest the
    network, leading to delays or complete gridlock. Setting a transaction
    threshold reduces the number of trivial transactions.

  <h2>What is the Withdrawal Fee?</h2>
  <p>
    As transactions incur costs from both ends, selling digital currency on our
    platform requires a minimum of a 0.1% Withdrawal Fee.
